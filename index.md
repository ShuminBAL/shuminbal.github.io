I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow working with <a href="https://statbiomed.github.io/">Dr. Yuanhua Huang </a> and  <a href="http://luo-lab.hk/">Dr. Ruibang Luo</a>.

<br />
Previously, I obtained my Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Hong Kong in 2022, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/rbluo">Dr. Ruibang Luo</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/twlam">Prof. Tak-Wah Lam</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/smyiu">Prof. Siuming Yiu</a>.

<br/>

My general interest focuses on applying computational methods and AI techniques to decipher biological data. I've led and participated in various projects covering the following topics: 1) Population Genetics, 2) Spatial Transcriptomics, 3) Gene Regulatory Networks, 4) Single Molecule Localization Microscopy, 5) Small Variant Calling for Long Read Sequencing, and 6) Protein Remote Homology Detection.

<br/>
Outside of work, I enjoy running and hiking. I recently completed my first half marathon in Shunde, Guangdong (time cost: 2h10m).
